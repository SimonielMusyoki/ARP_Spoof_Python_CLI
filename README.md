# ARP_Spoof_Python_CLI

The effects of ARP spoofing attacks can have serious implications for enterprises. In their most basic application, ARP spoofing attacks are used to steal sensitive information. Beyond this, ARP spoofing attacks are often used to facilitate other attacks such as:
<ul>
<li>Denial-of-service attacks: DoS attacks often leverage ARP spoofing to link multiple IP addresses with a single target’s MAC address. As a result, traffic that is intended for many different IP addresses will be redirected to the target’s MAC address, overloading the target with traffic.</li>
<li>Session hijacking: Session hijacking attacks can use ARP spoofing to steal session IDs, granting attackers access to private systems and data.</li>
<li>Man-in-the-middle attacks: MITM attacks can rely on ARP spoofing to intercept and modify traffic between victims.</li>

</ul>

I wrote this code to help hackers practising python to have an insight of how ARP spoofers do thier work.

It runs on the terminal using <i>Command Line Args</i> 

Type python3 arp_spoof.py --help for more help
